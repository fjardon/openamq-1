    JPMorgan Chase Bank & Co., Cisco Systems, Inc., Envoy Technologies Inc., 
    iMatix Corporation, IONA Technologies, Red Hat, Inc., 
    TWIST Process Innovations, and 29West Inc. (collectively, the
    "Authors") each hereby grants to you a worldwide, perpetual,
    royalty-free, nontransferable, nonexclusive license to (i) copy,
    display, distribute and implement the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol
    ("AMQP") Specification and (ii) the Licensed Claims that are held by
    the Authors, all for the purpose of implementing the Advanced Messaging
    Queue Protocol Specification. Your license and any rights under this
    Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from any Author if
    you bring any claim, suit, demand, or action related to the Advanced
    Messaging Queue Protocol Specification against any Author.  Upon
    termination, you shall destroy all copies of the Advanced Messaging
    Queue Protocol Specification in your possession or control.

    As used hereunder, "Licensed Claims" means those claims of a patent or
    patent application, throughout the world, excluding design patents and
    design registrations, owned or controlled, or that can be sublicensed
    without fee and in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement,
    by an Author or its affiliates now or at any future time and which
    would necessarily be infringed by implementation of the Advanced
    Messaging Queue Protocol Specification. A claim is necessarily
    infringed hereunder only when it is not possible to avoid infringing it
    because there is no plausible non-infringing alternative for
    implementing the required portions of the Advanced Messaging Queue
    Protocol Specification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensed Claims
    shall not include any claims other than as set forth above even if
    contained in the same patent as Licensed Claims; or that read solely on
    any implementations of any portion of the Advanced Messaging Queue
    Protocol Specification that are not required by the Advanced Messaging
    Queue Protocol Specification, or that, if licensed, would require a
    payment of royalties by the licensor to unaffiliated third parties.
    Moreover, Licensed Claims shall not include (i) any enabling
    technologies that may be necessary to make or use any Licensed Product
    but are not themselves expressly set forth in the Advanced Messaging
    Queue Protocol Specification (e.g., semiconductor manufacturing
    technology, compiler technology, object oriented technology, networking
    technology, operating system technology, and the like); or (ii) the
    implementation of other published standards developed elsewhere and
    merely referred to in the body of the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol
    Specification, or (iii) any Licensed Product and any combinations
    thereof the purpose or function of which is not required for compliance
    with the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification. For purposes
    of this definition, the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification
    shall be deemed to include both architectural and interconnection
    requirements essential for interoperability and may also include
    supporting source code artifacts where such architectural,
    interconnection requirements and source code artifacts are expressly
    identified as being required or documentation to achieve compliance
    with the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification.
 
    As used hereunder, "Licensed Products" means only those specific
    portions of products (hardware, software or combinations thereof) that
    implement and are compliant with all relevant portions of the Advanced
    Messaging Queue Protocol Specification.
 
    The following disclaimers, which you hereby also acknowledge as to any
    use you may make of the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol
    Specification:

  work with distributed transactions

<doc>
  Distributed transactions provide so-called "2-phase commit".  The
  AMQP distributed transaction model supports the X-Open XA
  architecture and other distributed transaction implementations.
  The Dtx class assumes that the server has a private communications
  channel (not AMQP) to a distributed transaction coordinator.

    dtx                 = C:SELECT S:SELECT-OK

<method name = "select" synchronous = "1" index = "10">
select standard transaction mode
  <doc>
    This method sets the channel to use distributed transactions.  The
    client must use this method at least once on a channel before
    using the Start method.
  </doc>
  <chassis name = "server" implement = "MUST" />
  <response name = "select-ok" />
</method>

<method name = "select-ok" synchronous = "1" index = "11">
confirm transaction mode
  <doc>
    This method confirms to the client that the channel was successfully
    set to use distributed transactions.

  <chassis name = "client" implement = "MUST" />

<method name = "start" synchronous = "1" index = "20">
  start a new distributed transaction
  <doc>
    This method starts a new distributed transaction.  This must be
    the first method on a new channel that uses the distributed
    transaction mode, before any methods that publish or consume
    messages.

  <chassis name = "server" implement = "MAY" />

  <field name = "dtx identifier" type = "shortstr">
    transaction identifier
    <doc>
      The distributed transaction key. This identifies the transaction
      so that the AMQP server can coordinate with the distributed
      transaction coordinator.
    </doc>
    <assert check = "notnull" />
  </field>
</method>

<method name = "start-ok" synchronous = "1" index = "21">
  confirm the start of a new distributed transaction
  <doc>
    This method confirms to the client that the transaction started.
    Note that if a start fails, the server raises a channel exception.
